## SQL Basics and Advanced Concepts

### Window Functions

Learn how window functions enable complex data analysis without aggregating results. See examples with:
- `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- `NTILE()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`

[View window function examples](./SQL-Concepts/Window-Functions.md).

### Subqueries

Understand how to use subqueries in various scenarios:
- Correlated vs. uncorrelated subqueries
- Using subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses

[View subquery examples](./SQL-Concepts/Subqueries.md).

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Master the use of CTEs for better readability and maintainability in complex queries:
- Recursive CTEs
- Using CTEs with multiple query steps

[View CTE examples](./SQL-Concepts/CTEs.md).

## Practical Use Cases

Explore practical scenarios where SQL is applied to solve real-world data problems:
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for handling missing or inconsistent data
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Creating summary tables and dashboards
- **Database Design**: Demonstrating normalization and database schema creation

Find these use cases [here](./Practical-Use-Cases).
